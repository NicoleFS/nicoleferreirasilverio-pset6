the start for my own app in which a user can look up recipes by entering ingredients

Peer review by Arend van Dormalen

Naming: 3 – I should be a bit more descriptive in the naming of my variables
Headers: 1 – Headers are most of the time not present and if they are present, they are too concise.
Comments: 3 – Sometimes I'm a bit too wordy in my comments and some comments are unnecessary. Preferably English comments, mine are Dutch.
Layout: 4 – I still have some commented out code in my files, which I should delete before I hand in my project.
Formatting: 4 – According to my reviewer, the formatting is good.
Flow: 3 – In GroceryListActivity I call the method "this.setData" in OnCreate, but I could also just put the code from setData completely 
  in OnCreate, it is not necessary to call the method.
Idiom: 4 – Not a lot of control structures present, so maybe I should add some more. According to my reviewer, whenever I do use control
  structures, they are used in a good way.
Expressions: 3 – Sometimes I make an unnecessary method call, but overall the control flow is fine.
Decomposition: 4 – My methods have a clear goal, and they are nicely separated.
Modularization: 4 – Every file has a clear function.
